The Binding of Isaac FPS
<h1>Description </h1>
<h2>Inspiration </h2>
<p>This game is based off of the Binding of Isaac Rebirth and its DLCs. It is an first person shooter version of the game, or rather, is based off of it. </p>
<h2>What Is It? </h2>
<p>Rather than explain the whole game, here is the link to the Wikipedia for the Binding of Isaac : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game). In my game, the player needs to move from room to room, killing enemies and picking up items. At the end of each floor, there is a boss, whom the player needs to kill in order to progress. </p>

<h1>Interaction</h1>
<p>Using Makey Makey, four pads will be made. These pads will each correspond to a key used for movement. The player will step on these pads in order to move. Leap motion will be used to track the player's hand. The difference between the hand's position from the current frame and the last frame will be used to pan and tilt the camera. Lastly, the player will hold a button (Makey Makey, once again) in order to shoot a bullet when pressed. </p>
