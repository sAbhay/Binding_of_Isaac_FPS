<h1>Interaction</h1>
<p>Using Makey Makey, four pads will be made. These pads will each correspond to a key used for movement. The player will step on these pads in order to move. Leap motion will be used to track the player's hand. The difference between the hand's position from the current frame and the last frame will be used to pan and tilt the camera. Lastly, the player will hold a button (Makey Makey, once again) in order to shoot a bullet when pressed. </p>
